### Initialize PostgreSQL bash shell

 - To open PostgreSQL bash shell and immediately connect to photo_module database:
  - in terminal, run: ```psql photo_module```

 - PostgreSQL shell connection to photo_module database will show command line: ```photo_module=#```

### Following commands are executed from psql bash shell.

 - 1: To describe all tables in selected databast, use ```\dt```
   - 1.1: Or, describe a specific table ```\dt <table_name>```
 - 2: To connect to another database, use: ```\c <database>```
 - 3: List all databases: ```\l```
 - 4: List all schemas of selected db: ```\dn```

 - 5: To execute a query with feedback use prefix: ```EXPLAIN ANALYZE <query>```

 ```cd usr/local/Cellar/cassandra/3.11.4/bin/```

 - Then, from any terminal bash, run: ```cqlsh --color``` to open the Cassandra bash shell using colored output text.
 - May omit the ```--color``` and just execute ```cqlsh``` as default command.

 - To run a Cassandra .cql file from the command line, execute:
```cqlsh --file= "<filename>"```

 - So, for executing the Cassandra schema file creating the keyspace 'photo_module' and table 'photos_listings', from schema.cql
